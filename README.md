##Udacity Android - Super Duo! Project #3 Starter Kit

This is an optimized repository starter kit for the Udacity Android Developer
Nanodegree Project #3 "Super Duo!" project. All extraneous binary files have
been removed to reduce disk space usage and the Gradle project files have been
updated for SDK 22 and Gradle 1.3.

Fork this project, rename (e.g. Udacity-SuperDuo) and start working.

Note: No code has been changed.
